# Synonymous

Python script that prints synonyms for the last word you typed. 
Created the script to write fancy and formal essays. 

# Installation

Just download as zip and run the main.py using python.


# Needs to done

- Special characthers show in html code form. Need a converter to change characthers like ', !, ., 
- Some cosmetics would be good. 
- Might add a UI with tkinter

The code is a mess so good luck if you are trying to edit :D
